The launcher package includes a launch_platform.bat Batch script.

This script can be called with a bunch of arguments to automatically handle calls to any version branch you wish, if you don't want to code your own launcher to handle the branches.

Using the script comes with the benefit that if and when a new version branch rolls out and comes packaged with major launcher-breaking changes, the launch platform will likely update to internally support the new branch.
